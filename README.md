Welcome to my **neovim** config folder

Through out the years (4 years) of using Neovim, I have came up with a very large neovim configuration. But now I drop most of them. Neovim support for Lua script is on the way, this rewrite will be all (most of) in Lua. I prefer the LISP syntax over Lua syntax, so I use Fennel with aniseed.

There will be a lightline configuration, everyone loves a nice UI.

I mostly code in C, C++, Python, Golang, Javascript, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Haskell (ordered by my own usage frequency).


## Change log

- Initialize the Git Repo
- Switch from pure VimL to Lua using Fennel+aniseed
- Switch from vim-plug to packer.nvim
- Old neovim
